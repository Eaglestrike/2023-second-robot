MONDAY:
0. Phoenix tuner: get ids for both motors and encoder
1. Get cur pose correct w offset and everything
2. Get target pose correct, test triangle, trapezoid w pos neg (so 4 diff cases) make math checks out
Q. Figure out how to tune kv ka
CONSTS BY END OF TODAY:
- wrist & roller motor id
- encoder pin
- trapezoidal motion profile max velocity and max acc (ask cad?)
- wrist tolerance
- encoder offset so that 0 is parallel to the ground
- stowed and deployed position
- max volts (ask cad?)

TUES:
4. tune g, s
5. Tune v and a
basic feedforward works
6 tune PID w the feedforward by pushing it around


THURS
7 tune PID for keeping stowed, finish
